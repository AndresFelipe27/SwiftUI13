We had a couple of beers and a nice talk. Tom told us about his new job, and Jim told us about his new girlfriend. After a while, we went to a restaurant and had pizza. I went to bed late that night, but I was very happy. On Saturday morning I went running in the park. I ran 5 kilometers, and then came home. After that, I met my girlfriend for lunch. We went to a Thai restaurant near my house. I love Thai food!")
